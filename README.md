# CS412 Final Project - Coin Betting Game

 - **Server:** Run Server.java
 - **User:** Run Controller.java

This code is made to run on *localhost:5000*, but the address and port can be changed for different uses. Only one instance of the server should be running, but many controllers can be run at once. The server stores user information on a SQLite database, and if run in Visual Studio Code, the database is already imported. If you try to run it in a different IDE, you may need to import SQLite in a different manner.
